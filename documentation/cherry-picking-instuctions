## Pre-Cherry-pick

- int-a is on QA
- build fix in int-b (currently in beta)
- push fix to int-b as usual



## The Cherry-pick

- `git checkout int-a`
- create a new branch `git checkout -b cp-xxxxxx`
- from the new branch run `git cherry-pick xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` (using the full commit sha)
- push to new branch `git push origin cp-xxxxxx`
- on github create the pr making sure to change the base branch to int-a (it will likely be defaulted to int-b)
